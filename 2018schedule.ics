DESCRIPTION:ELF executables are often statically linked for COTS binaries
  to avoid dependency issues and to keep things simple. After all\, why n
 ot build a binary as statically linked? ASLR and RelRO (read-only reloca
 tions) are two extremely important binary mitigation techniques that are
  presently incompatible with statically linked binaries. This talk prese
 nts the surprisingly dangerous attack surface of statically linked execu
 tables and a solution that demonstrates working ASLR and RELRO with stat
 ically linked executables by using binary instrumentation techniques.

 \nThese vulnerabilities are more traditionally seen as means to move lat

  leveraging a few modern browser features and modern reconnaissance tech

DESCRIPTION:Designing circuits and laying out a printed circuit board (PC
 B) can be a complicated and intensive process. It also happens to be a v
 ery expensive process as well\, which is why there are many shortcuts an
 d tricks that design engineers use to cut down cost and time of developm
 ent. Being aware of these shortcuts and tricks can also save time when r
 everse engineering hardware. Implementing security and countermeasures o
 n PCBs are the last\, if not ever\, a priority for design engineers. In 
 this presentation I will point out where there are some fundamental aspe
 cts of the hardware design engineering process and being aware of them c
 an directly lead to finding vulnerabilities in hardware.

DESCRIPTION:Music videos and visual effects try to capture and enhance th
 e feeling of the music you're listening to\, but what if the visuals act
 ually were the music? Jerobeam Fenderson blends audio and visual with hi
 s mind-blowing experience called Oscilloscope Music.\n\nOscilloscopes ar
 e test equipment used to measure voltages for debugging electronics syst
 ems. Older vintage analog oscilloscopes have an "XY mode" which plots vo
 ltages of 2 channels on a display. Over the years people have hacked tog
 ether video games and other demos abusing this feature to display graphi
 cs\, but Jerobeam Fenderson is the first to take this form of art to ano
 ther level by doing it audio signals to create a whole new form of perfo
 rmance art.\n \nAlthough the idea of “seeing music” is hard to grapple w
 ith\, the close correlation between image and sound makes for an immersi
 ve sensory experience. Minimalistic green lines form abstract lissajous 
 shapes that mutate into complex vector graphics\, using the left and rig
 ht audio channels as X and Y coordinates. Oscilloscope Music turns the t
 ransformation of abstract concepts into something tangible that works on
  an emotional level outside of its technical context. Using this approac
 h\, math doesn’t seem like the dry concept it is often seen as\, but rat
 her a key to the fundamental principles of nature.

  is not simply about the alcohol quantity in your evening or the B.A.C.

  and a discerning palate.\n\nThis workshop will step people through some
  of the basics of booze\, distinguishing good offerings from poor ones\,
  discerning flavor notes\, DIY liquor hacks\, and of course demonstratin
 g the creation of outstanding cocktails. Just like last year\, audience

DESCRIPTION:Unlike software\, the basic language of hardware -- physics -
 - has not changed since the beginning of time as we know it. The notion 
 that "hardware is hard" is more a function of society's changing mores a
 round intellectual freedom\, ownership norms\, and economic values. Duri
 ng the dot-com boom of the 90's\, the best and brightest shelved their s
 oldering irons in favor of PHP and CSS. The West largely shed its electr
 onics manufacturing base to Asia\, while lobbyists pushed laws that crim
 inalized exploration and reinforced IP monopolies. Now\, we walk astonis
 hed through the streets of Shenzhen and marvel at their magical supply c
 hain. Ironically\, nothing fundamental has changed about hardware in the
  past 30 years -- we're still building CPUs using CMOS\, systems using c
 opper on FR-4\, exchanging data on the same wavelengths\, albeit with be
 tter modulation and a whole lot more patents. What we've forgotten isn't
  hardware -- what we've forgotten is what it's like to have the freedom 
 to explore and innovate in hardware. If we forget the origins of the hac
 ker ethos\; if we don't fight to bring back these freedoms: we ultimatel
 y risk surrendering control over the very hardware that runs our daily l
 ives.\n

DESCRIPTION:People to go into tech tend to want to focus on the concrete 
 - but the first step in hacking a system is understanding it. You are on
 ly human - and all your friends are only human\, too. If you want to mak
 e great things\, you're going to need a team.\n\nGood management is lear
 ning how to program and load-balance people\, and that includes self-car
 e. Let's talk about how to reverse-engineer yourself\, so you can genuin
 ely care for yourself (and others) so that you're not constantly segfaul
 ting.
